Basically, you'd be writing a 3 minute movie. The winner would be Tanjiro but the rest would be based on your best opinion.\n\nSo you would have to direct a fight via text form. you'll have to add the dialogue, what exactly happens in the scenes, and the overall story.\n\nHere's a sample fight.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6bp6OflTe8&t=2s",
